Find \(\frac{d y}{d x}\), if x
2
 + xy + y
2
 = 100

Solution:

x
2
 + xy + y
2
 = 100

Differentiating with respect to x.

2x + x \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) + y(1) + 2y \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = 0

⇒ (x + 2y) \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = -(2x + y)

Question 24.

A random variable X has the following probability distribution:

Determine:

(i) k

(ii) P(X ≥ 2)

Solution:

The probability distribution of X is



(i) We know that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} p i=1\)

Therefore 0.1 + k + 2k + 2k + k = 1

⇒ k = 0.15


(ii) P(you study at least two hours) = P(X ≥ 2)

= P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)

= 2k + 2k + k

= 5k

= 5 × 0.15

= 0.75

P(you study exactuly two hours) = P(X = 2)

= 2k

= 2 × 0.15

= 0.3

P(you study at most two hours) = P(X ≤ 2)

= P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

= 0.1 + k + 2k

= 0.1 + 3k

= 0.1 +3 × 0.15

= 0.55

Answer any TEN questions: (10 × 3 = 30)


Question 25.

Show that the relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} given by R = {(a, b) : |a – b| is even}, is an equivalence relation.

Solution:

|a – a| = |o| = 0 is even

(a, a) ∈ R.

∴ R is reflexive.

Let (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ |a – b| is even

⇒ |-(a – b)| is even

⇒ |(b – a)| is even

⇒ (b, a) ∈ R

∴ R is symmetric.

Let (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R

⇒ |a – b| is even and |b – c| is even

⇒ a – b is even

⇒ b – c is even

⇒ a – b + b – c is even

⇒ a – c is even

⇒ |a – c| is even

∴ (a, c) ∈ R.

∴ R is transitive

∴ R is an equivalence relation.

Solution:






Question 28.

If x = sin t, y = cos 2t then prove that \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = -4 sin t


Question 29.

Verify Rolle’s theorem for the function f(x) = x
2
 + 2, x ∈ [-2, 2]

Solution:

The function y = x
2
 + 2 is Continuous in {-2, 2} and differentiable in (-2, 2). Also f(-2) = f(2) = 6 and hence the value of f(x) at -2 and 2 coincide.

Rolle’s theorem states that there is a point c ∈ (-2, 2) where f'(c) = 0. Since f'(x) = 2x, we get c = 0. Thus at c = 0, we have f'(c) = 0 and c = 0 ∈ (-2, 2).


Question 30.

Find two numbers whose sum is 24 and whose product is as large as possible.

Solution:

Let one number be x. Then, the other number is (24 – x).

(∵ Sum of the two numbers is 24)

Let y denotes the product of the two numbers. Thus, we have

y = x(24 – x) = 24x – x
2

On differentiating twice w.r.t. x, we get

\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = 24 – 2x and \(\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}\) = -2

Now, put \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = 0

⇒ 24 – 2x = 0

⇒ x = 12

At x = 12, \(\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}\) = -2 < 0

∴ By second derivative test, x = 12 is the point of local mxima of y. Thus, the product of the number is maximum when the numbers are 12 and 24 – 12 = 12.

Hence, the numbers are 12 and 12.




Question 31.

Find: \(\int \frac{x d x}{(x+1)(x+2)}\)


Question 32.

Find: ∫e
x
 sin x dx

Solution:

Take e
x
 as the first function and sin x as second function. Then integrating by parts, we have

I = ∫e
x
 sin x dx = e
x
 (-cos x) + ∫e
x
 cos x dx = -e
x
 cos x + I
1
 (say) …… (1)

Taking e
x
 and cos x as the first and second functions, respectively, in I
1
, we get

I = e
x
 sin x – ∫e
x
 sin x dx

Substituting the value of I
1
 in (i), we get

I = -e
x
 cos x + e
x
 sin x – 1 or 2I = e
x
 (sin x – cos x)

Hence I = ∫e
x
 sin x dx = \(\frac{e^{x}}{2}\) (sin x – cos x) + C


Question 33.

Find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = x

 and the line y = 4.

Find the equation of the plane through the intersection of the planes 3x – y + 2z – 4 = 0 and x + y + z – 2 = 0 and the point (2, 2, 1).

Question 43.

Sand is pouring from a pipe at the rate of 12 cm
3
/s. The falling sand forms a cone on the ground is such a way that the height of the cone is always one-sixth of the radius of the base. How fast is the height of the sand cone increasing when the height is 4 cm?

Solution:

Let r be the radius, h be the height and V be the volume of the sand cone at any time t.



Hence, when the height of the sand cone is 4 cm, its height is increasing at the rate of \(\frac{1}{48 \pi}\) cm/s.

Now equation of the sides AB, BD and CA are given by

y = 2(x – 1), y = 4 – x, y = \(\frac{1}{2}\)(x – 1) respectively

Hence, area of ∆

) respectively that are lying on a line.

Let \(\overrightarrow { r }\) be the position vector of an arbitrary point P(x, y, z), then P is a point on the line if and only if \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{AP}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{r}}-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{AB}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{b}}-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\) are collinear vectors. Therefore, P is on the line if and only

Subject to the constraints:

x + 3y ≤ 60, x + y ≥ 10, x ≤ y, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0.

The coordinates of the corner point A, B, C and D are (0, 10), (5, 5), (15, 15) and (0, 20) respectively.





We now find the minimum and maximum value of Z. From the table, we find that the minimum value of Z is 60 at point B (5, 5) of the feasible region.

The maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two comer points C(15, 15) and D(0, 20) and it is 180 in each case.
