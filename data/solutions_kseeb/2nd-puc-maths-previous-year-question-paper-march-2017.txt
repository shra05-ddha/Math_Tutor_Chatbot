Answer any TEN questions: (10 × 2 = 20)


Question 11.

If f : R → R defined by f(x) = 1 + x
2
, then show that f is neither 1-1 nor onto.

Solution:

f(1) = 1 + 1
2
 = 2

f(-1) = 1 + (-1)
2
 = 2

∴ f(1) = f(-1) But 1 ≠ -1

∴ f is not one-one

Let y ∈ R ∃ x ∈ R such that

f(x) = y

⇒ 1 + x
2
 = y

⇒ x
2
 = y – 1

⇒ x = \(\sqrt{y-1}\)

if y = 0 then x = \(\sqrt{-1} \notin \mathrm{R}\)

∴ 0 has no pre-image

∴ f is not onto.




Question 12.



Solution:

Solution:



⇒ -2k + 8 = 8

⇒ 2k =

⇒ k = 0

on taking -ve sign we get -2k + 8 = -8

⇒ 2k = 16

⇒ k = 8

∴ k = 0, 8.


Question 15.

If ax + by
2
 = cos y, find \(\frac{d y}{d x}\)

Solution:




Question 16.

Verify Rolle’s theorem for the function f(x) = x
2
 + 2x – 8, x ∈ [-4, 2]

Solution:

f(x) is a polynomial in x. Flence it is continuous over {-4, 2} and differentiable over (-4, 2).

f(-4) = (-4)
2
 + 2(-4) – 8 = 16 – 8 – 8 = 0

f(2) = 4 + 4 – 8 = 0

∴ f(-4) = f(2)

∴ All the conditions of the Rolle’s theorem are satisfied.

∴ there exists a c ∈ [-4, 2] such that

f'(c) = 0

f'(x) = 2x + 2

f'(c) = 2c + 2

f'(c) = 0

⇒ 2c + 2 = 0

⇒2c = -2

⇒ c = -1 ∈ [-4, 2]

∴ Rolle’s theorem is verified.




Question 17.

\(\vec{a}=3 \hat{i}-2 \hat{j}-5 \hat{k}\) and \(b=3 \hat{i}-2 \hat{j}+6 \hat{k}\)

We know that the vector equation of a line passing through the points having position vectors a and b is \(r=\vec{a}+\lambda(\vec{b}-\vec{a})\)






Question 24.

Find the probability distribution of the number of heads in two tosses of a coin.

Solution:

When one coin is tossed twice, the sample space is

S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

Let X denotes, the number of heads in any outcome in S,

X(HH) = 2, X(HT) = 1, X(TH) = 1 and X(TT) = 0

Therefore, X can take the value of 0, 1 or 2. It is known that

P(HH) = P(HT) = P(TH) = P(TT) = \(\frac{1}{4}\)

P(X = 0) = P (tail occurs on both tosses) = P({TT}) = \(\frac{1}{4}\)

P(X = 1) = P(one head and one tail occurs) = P({TH, HT}) = \(\frac{2}{4}\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\)

and P(X = 2) = P (head occurs on both tosses) = P({HH}) = \(\frac{1}{4}\)

Thus, the required probability distribution is as follows.




Part – C


Anstver any TEN questions: (10 × 3 = 30)


Question 25.

Show that the relation R in R (set of real numbers) is defined as R = {(a, b) : a ≤ b} is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric.

Solution:

a ≤ a is always true

∴ (a, a) R a R

∴ R is reflexive

Let (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ a ≤ b which does not imply b ≤ a

∴ (b, a) ∉ R

∴ R is not symmetric

Let (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R

⇒ a ≤ b and b ≤ c

⇒ a ≤ c

⇒ (a, c) ∈ R

∴ R is transitive




Question 26.

Write \(\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}-1}{x}\right)\), x ≠ 0 in the simplest form.

Solution:




Question 27.

If A and B are symmetric matrices of the same order, then show that AB is symmetric if and only if AB = BA.

Solution:

Let A and B are symmetric

∴ A’ = A and B’ = B

Let AB is symmetric

∴ (AB)’ = AB, B’A’ = AB, BA = AB

Conversely, Let AB = BA

(AB)’ = B’A’ = BA = AB

∴ AB is symmetric


Question 28.

Differentiate (log x) cos x with respect to x.

Solution:

Let cos x

y = (log x) cos x

log y = log (log x)

log y = cos x (log x)




Question 29.

Differentiate sin
2
 x with respect to e
cos x
.

Solution:




Question 30.

Find two positive numbers x and y such that x + y = 60 and xy
3
 is maximum.

Solution:

Let the two numbers be x, y and P = xy
3

Given x + y = 60 ⇒ x = 60 – y

On putting this value in P = xy
3
, we get

P = (60 – y) y
3
 ⇒ P = 60y
3
 – y
4

On differentiating twice w.r.t. y, we get

\(\frac{d P}{d y}\) = 180y
2
 – 4y
3

and \(\frac{d^{2} P}{d y^{2}}\) = 360y – 12y
2

For maxima, we must have \(\frac{d P}{d y}\) = 0

⇒ 180y
2
 – 4y
3
 = 0

⇒ 4y
2
(45 – y) = 0

⇒ y = 0, 45

But y ≠ 0, so y = 45

At y = 45, \(\left(\frac{d^{2} P}{d y^{2}}\right)_{y=45}\) = 360 × 45 – 12 × (45)
2

=16200 – 24300

= -8100 < 0

⇒ P has afocal maxima at y = 45

∴ By second derivative test, x = 45 is a point of local maxima of P. Thus, the function xy
3
 is maximum when y = 45 and x = 60 – 45 = 15.

Hence, the required numbers are 15 and 45.




Question 31.

Evaluate \(\int \frac{2 x}{x^{2}+3 x+2} d x\)

2
 = 4x, y-axis and the line y = 3.

Solution:






Question 34.

Form the differential equation of the family of circles having a centre on y-axis and radius 3 units.

Solution:

The equation of the family circles having centre on y-axis and radius 3 unit is

x
2
 + (y – b)
2
 = 9 …….(i)

On differentiating Eq. (i) w.r.t x, we get

2x + 2(y – b) y’ = 0

⇒ y – b = \(-\frac{x}{y^{\prime}}\) ……. (ii)

On substituting this value of (y – b) in Eq. (i) we get

\(x^{2}+\left(-\frac{x}{y^{\prime}}\right)^{2}=9\)

⇒ x
2
[(y’)
2
 + 1] = 9(y’)
2

⇒ (x
2
 – 9)(y’)
2
 + x
2
 = 0

which is the required differential equation.

Solution:






Question 38.

Given that the two numbers appearing on throwing two dice are different. Find the probability of the event ‘the sum of numbers on the dice is 4’.

Solution:

When dice is thrown, number of observations in the sample space S = 6 × 6 = 36 (equally likely sample events)

i.e., n(S) = 36

Let E : set of numbers in which numbers appearing on the two dice are different

Then, E = {(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)}

⇒ n(E) = 3



n(F) = 30

Here, F contains all points of S except {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3),(4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)}

E ∩ F = {(1, 3), (3, 1)}

The length x of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of 5 cm/minute and the width y is increasing at the rate of 4 cm/minute when x = 8 cm and y = 6 cm, find the rate of change of

(i) The perimeter and

(ii) The are of the rectangle.

Solution:

At any instant of time t, let length, breadth, perimeter and area of the rectangle are x, y, P and A respectively, then

P = 2(x + y) and A = xy …… (i)

It is given that \(\frac{d x}{d t}\) = -5 cm/mm and \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = -5 = 4 cm/min

(-ve sign shows that the length is decreasing)

(i) Now, P = 2(x + y).

On differentiating w.r.t. t, we get Rate of change of pert meter

\(\frac{d P}{d t}=2\left(\frac{d x}{d t}+\frac{d y}{d t}\right)\)

= 2(-5 + 4) cm/min

= -2 cm/min [∴ \(\frac{d x}{d t}\) = -5 and \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = 4]

Hence, perimeter of the rectangle is decreasing (-ve sign) at the rate of 2 cm/min.

(ii) Here, area of rectangle A = xy.

On differentiating w.r.t. t, we get

Rate of change \(\frac{d A}{d t}=x \frac{d y}{d t}+y \frac{d x}{d t}\)

= 8 × 4 + 6 × (5) [∴ \(\frac{d x}{d t}\) = -5 and \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = 4]

= 32 – 30

= 2 cm
2
/min

Hence, area of the rectangle is increasing at the rate of 2 cm
2
/min.

Note: It rate of change is increasing, we take positive sign and if the rate of change is decreasing, then we take a negative sign.

Derive the equation of a plane perpendicular to a given vector and passing through a given point both in vector and Cartesian form.

Solution:

Vector Form

Let a plane pass through a point A with position vector \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\) and perpendicular to the vector \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{N}}\)

Let \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{r}}\) be the position vector of any point P(x, y, z) in the plane.

Then the point P lies in the plane if and only if \(\overline{\mathrm{AP}}\) is perpendicular to \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{N}}\)

i.e. \(\overline{\mathrm{AP}} \cdot \overline{\mathrm{N}}=0\)

But \(\overline{\mathrm{AP}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{r}}-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\)

Therefore \((\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}) \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathrm{N}}=0\) …….. (1)

This is the vector equation of the plane.

Let the given point A be (x
1
, y
1
