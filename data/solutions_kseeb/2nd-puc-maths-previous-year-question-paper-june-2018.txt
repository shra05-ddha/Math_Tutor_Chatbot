Time: 3 Hrs 15 Min

Max. Marks: 100


 






Instructions




The question paper has five parts namely A, B, C, D, and E. Answer all the parts.


Use the graph sheet for the question on Linear programming in Part – E




Part – A


 






Answer ALL the following questions: (10 × 1 = 10)


Question 1.

The relation R on set A = {1, 2, 3} is defined as R {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is not transitive. Why?

Solution:

(1, 2) ∈ R, (2, 3) ∈ R. But (1, 3) ∉ R


 






Question 2.

Write the range of y = cos
-1
 x

Solution:

[0, π]


Question 3.

If a matrix has 5 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?

Solution:

1 × 5, 5 × 1




Question 4.

Find the values of x for which \(\left|\begin{array}{cc}x & 2 \\18 & x\end{array}\right|=\left|\begin{array}{cc}6 & 2 \\18 & 6\end{array}\right|\)

Solution:

x
2
 = 36 ⇒ x = ±6


 






Question 5.

Find \(\frac{d y}{d x}\), if y = sin(ax + b)

Solution:

\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = a cos(ax + b)


Question 6.

Evaluate: ∫sec x (sec x + tan x) dx

Solution:

I = ∫sec
2
 x dx + ∫ sec x tan x dx = tan x + sec x + c


 






Question 7.

Define the negative of a vector.

Solution:

Negative of the vector is obtained by changing the direction of the given vector into the opposite direction or by multiplying the given vector by -1.

Say \(\vec{a}\) be the given vector so negative of \(\vec{a}\) is –\(\vec{a}\)

\(\vec{a}\) and –\(\vec{a}\) will have the same magnitude but opposite direction.


Question 8.

Solution:




 






Question 9.

Solution:

Any feasible solution of LPP which maximizes or minimizes the objective function is called an optimal solution.




Question 10.

Find P(A/B), if P(B) = 0.5 and P(A∩B) = 0.32.

Solution:




Part – B


Answer any TEN questions: (10 × 2 = 20)


Question 11.

Define binary operation on a set. Verify whether the operation * is defined on Q set of rational numbers by a * b = ab + 1, ∀ a, b ∈ Q is binary or not.

Solution:

A binary operation on a set A is a function

* : A × A → A

a * b = ab + 1 ∈ Q

∴ * is a Binary Operation on Q.

Question 17.

If the radius of a sphere is measured as 7 m with an error of 0.02 m, then find the approximate error in calculating its volume.

Solution:

Let r be the radius of the sphere and ∆r be the error in measuring radius.

Then, r = 7 m and ∆r = 0.02 m

Now, volume of a sphere is given by V = \(\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}\)

On differentiate w.r.t r, we get \(\frac{d V}{d r}=\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi\right)\left(3 r^{2}\right)=4 \pi r^{2}\)

ΔV = (\(\frac{d V}{d r}\)) Δr

= (4πr
2
) Δr

= 4π × 7
2
 × 0.002

= 3.92π m
3

Hence, the approximate error in calculating the volume is 3.92π m

Solution:

(a) ΣP(X) = 1

⇒ 6K = 1

⇒ K = \(\frac{1}{6}\)

(b) P(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)

= K + 2K

= 3K

= 3(\(\frac{1}{6}\))

= \(\frac{1}{2}\)

2
, then show that gof ≠ fog.


Question 26.

Solve : tan
-1
 2x + tan

Given x = a(θ – sin θ) and y = a(1 + cos θ)

Differentiating w.r.t θ, we get




Question 29.

Verify Mean Value Theorem if f(x) = x
2
 – 4x + 3 in the interval x ∈ [a, b], where a = 1 and b = 4.

Solution:

f(x) is a polynomial in x.

It is continuous in {1, 4} and differentiable in {1, 4) and f'(x) = 2x – 4.

There exists at least one value c ∈ (1, 4) such that f'(c) = \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\)

a = 1, f(a) = f(1) = 12 – 4(1) – 3 = 1 – 4 – 3 = 1 – 7 = -6

b = 4, f(b) = f(4) = 42 – 4(4) – 3 = 16 – 16 – 3 = -3

f'(c) = 2c – 4



∴ Mean Value theorem is verified.

Question 50(a).

Solve the following problem graphically:

Maximize and minimize

Z = 10500x + 9000y

Subject to the constraints

x + y ≤ 50

2x + y ≤ 80

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0

Solution:

x + y = 50

y = 0 ⇒ x = 50

∴ A = (50, 0), B = (0, 50)

(0, 0) lies on x + y ≤ 50

2x + y = 80

y = 0, x = 40 ⇒ C(40, 0)

x = 0, y = 80 ⇒ D(0, 80)

Origin lies on 2x + y ≤ 80

Solving x + y = 50

2x + y = 80 we get x = 30, y = 20

E = (30, 20)



OBEC is the feasible region.
