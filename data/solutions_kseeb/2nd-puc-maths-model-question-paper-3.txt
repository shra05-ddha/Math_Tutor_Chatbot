Answer:

y = cos(1 – x)

Dijf w.rl.x

\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = \(\frac{d}{d x}\) = cox(1 – x)

= -sin(1 – x) x \(\frac{d}{d x}\) (1 – x) dx

= -sin(1 – x)x – 1 = sin(1 – x)


Question 6.

Evaluate ∫(2x – 3 cos x + e
x

=> ∫(2x – 3cosx +e
x

Part – B


II. Answer any Ten questions :


Question 11.

S.T. function f : N → N by f (1) = f(2) = 1 and f(x) = x -1 for every x > 2, is on to but not one-one.

Answer:

f : N → N by f(1) = f(2) = 1 and f(x) = x – 1.

f is not one-one because

f (1) = 1 and f(2) = 1

∴ f(1) = f(2)

but

1≠2

∴ f is not one-one

for every y ∈ N then

f(x) = y – x – 1 then y = x – 1

⇒ x ∈ N

∴ y ∈ N ∋ x ∈ N

∴ f is onto.




Question 12.

P.T. tan

-1
 x = \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) ∀ x ∈R

Answer:

Let tan 
-1
 x = y

x = tan y = cot ( \(\pi / 2\) – y)

cot 
-1
 x = \(\pi / 2\) – y

cot 
-1
 x + y = \(\pi / 2\)

cot 
-1
 x – tan 
-1
 x = \(\pi / 2\)


Question 13.

Write the simplest form of \(\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos x}{1+\cos x}})\) 0 < x < π

Answer:




Question 14.

Find the equation of a line passing through (3,1) (9,3) using determinants.

Let P(x,y) be the line passing through (3,1) and (9,3)

∴ Let A(3,1) B (9,3)

∴ If P is a point on the line AB then Area of the Δ
le
 is zero



∴x(1 – 3) – y(3 – 9) + 1(9 – 9) = 0

-2x – y (-6) + (0) = 0

-2x + 6y = 0

6y = 2x

x = 3 y

∴ Equation of line is x = 3y


Question 15.

cos x

Answer:

y = (log x)
cos x

Take log on both side

log y – log(log x)
cos x

log y – cos x. log(log x)

Diff w.r.t x, we get




Question 17.

Approximate √36.6 by using differential.

Answer:

y = √x Let x = 36 and Ax = 0.6 then

Δy = \(\sqrt{x+\Delta x}-\sqrt{x}=\sqrt{36.6}-\sqrt{36}=\sqrt{36.6}-6\)

√36.6 = 6 + Δy

Now dy is approximately equal to Ay and is given by.



The approximate value of √36.6 is 6+0.05 = 6.05.


Question 18.

Integrate sinx. sin(cosx) w.r.t. x

∫sinx. sin(cosx).dx

Take cos x = t

Diff w.r.t x, we have

-sinx = \(\frac{d t}{d x}\)

-sin x.dx = dt

sin x.dx = -dt

⇒ ∫sin(cosx).sinx.dx

= ∫sin(t)λ – dt = – ∫ sin t.dt

= -x – cos t. + c =cost + c = cos(cosx) + c




Question 19.

Question 23.

Find the equation of the plane through the inter section of planes 3x – y + 2z – 4 = 0 and x + y – z – 2 = 0 and the point (2,2,1).

Answer:

Equation of any plane through the intersection of the given planes, is of the form.

3x – y + 2z – 4 + λ (x + y – z – 2) = 0

(3 + λ)x + (λ – 1)y + (2 – λ) z – (4 + 2λ) = 0

By Data it is passes through (2,2,1)

⇒ (3 + λ)2 + (λ -1)2 + (2 – λ)1 – (4 + 2λ) = 0

⇒ 6 + 2λ + 2λ – 2 + 2 – λ – 4 – 2λ = 0

⇒ 2 + λ = 0

λ = – 2

Thus the required equation is

(3 – 2)x + (-2 -1 )y + (+2 – 2)1 – (4 + 2(-2) = 0

x – 3y + (0)(1) – (4 – 4) = 0

x – 3y = 0




Question 24.

A die is thrown. If E is the event the number appearing is a multiple of 3 are F be the event the number appearing is even, then prove that E and F are independent events.

Answer:

A die is thrown the sample space are {1,2,3,4,5,6}

E is the event “the number appearing is a multiple of 3”

E = {3,6} P(E) = \(\frac{n(E)}{n(S)}=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}\)

F be the event the number appearing is even

F = {2, 4, 6} P(F) = \(\frac{n(F)}{n(S)}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}\)

⇒ (E∩F) = {6} =P(E∩F) =  \(\frac{n(E \cap F)}{n(s)}=\frac{1}{6}\)

∴P(E)

∴ P(E) × P(F) = P(E∩F)

∴ \(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{6}\)

∴ E and F are independent Events.

Question 47.

Derive equation of a line in a space through a given point and parallel to a vector both in the vector and cartesian form.

Answer:

Let \(\vec{a}\) be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origion O of the rectangular co-ordinate system. Let l be the line which passes through the point A and is parallel to a given vector \(\vec{b}\) Let \(\vec{r}\) be the position vector of an arbitary point P on the line.


Then \(\vec{AP}\) is parallel to the vector \(\vec{b}\) i.e. \(\overrightarrow {A P}=\lambda \vec{b}\) where λ is some real number.

But \(\overrightarrow{A P}=\overrightarrow{O P}-\overrightarrow{O A}\)

\(\lambda \vec{b}=\vec{r}-\vec{a}\)

Conversely for each value of the parameter λ, this equation gives the position vector of a point P on the line.

Hence the vector equantion of the line is given by

\(\vec{r}=\vec{a}+\lambda \vec{b}\)

Derivation of cartesian form from vector form.

Let the co-ordinates of the given point A be (x, y, z) and the direction ratios of the line a b c consider the co-ordinates of any point P be (x,y,z) then



Substituting these values in (1) and equating the co-efficients i, \(\hat{i}\) and \(\hat{r}\) we get

x = x

x + y = 60 which passes through C (60, 0) & B (0, 60) and x – 2y = 0 which passes through 0 (0, 0) & P (40, 20)

Now that P(40, 20) lies on BC also. Also x – 2y = 0&x + 2y= 120 meet in Q (60, 30)

The feasible region is shown shaded in the figure (indicated as feasible region) note that (0,0) does nopt lie in this region as it doesnot satisfy (3) The point C(60,0) lie this region as it saties fies all the constraints (2) (3) (4) and (5).



The corner points of the feasible region which are to be examined for optimum solution are C(60,0) A( 120,0) Q(60, 30) and P(40,20)

At C(60, 0), Z = 5 × 60 + 10 × 0 = 300

At A(120, 0), Z = 5 × 120 + 10 × 0 = 600

At Q(60, 30), Z = 5 × 60 + 10 × 30 = 600

At P(40, 20), Z = 5 × 40 + 10 × 20 = 400

Hence Z is minimum at C(60,0) and min Z = 300 and max Z = 600 at A and also at Q ⇒ max Z will be attained at every point of segment AQ.

b) Find the value of k, if

f(x) = \(\frac{1-\cos 2 x}{1-\cos x}\) , x≠ 0

f(x) = k ,x= 0

is continuous at x = 0.
