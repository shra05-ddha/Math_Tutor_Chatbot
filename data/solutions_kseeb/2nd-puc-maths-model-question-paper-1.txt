Question 14.

Let A(1, 3), B(0, 0) and C(K, 0) be the vertices of triangle ABC of area 3 sq. units. Find k using determinant method.

Answer:



A = \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) [1(0 – 0) – 3(0 – K) + 1(0 – 0)

A = \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\)[3K]

Given , Area = 3 sq. units,

Thus- \(\frac { 3k }{ 2 }\) = +3 \(\frac { 3k }{ 2 }\) = -3

⇒ 3k = 6, 3k = -6

k = 2, k = -2


Question 15.

Prove that greatest integer function defined by f(x) = [x], 0<<3 is not differentiable at x = 1

Answer:

Since fis not continuous at every Integral

point or at x= I

⇒ It follows that [x] cannot differentiate at x = 3.


Question 16.

Find \(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}\) ,If x 4t and y = \(\frac{4}{t}\)

Answer:

x = 4t \(\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} x}\) = 4

y = \(\frac{4}{t}\) \(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}\) = \(\frac{-4}{t^{2}}\)






Question 17.

Find the intervals in which the function fgivenby f(x) = x
2
 – 4x + 6 is strictly increasing.

Answer:

f(x) = x
2
 – 4x +6

f
1
 (x) = 2x -4

f
1
 (x ) =0 given, 2x – 4=0 ⇒ 2x =4

⇒ x = 2

Thus f
1
(x ) =0 at x =2

Now, the point x = 2 divides the real line

into two disjoint intervals namely,

(-∞,2) and (2,∞).

At (2,∞),f
1
 (x) > 0

⇒ f is strictly increasing at(2,∞)


Question 18.

Evaluate : ∫sin3x.cos4xdx

Answer:

Let I = ∫ sin 3x.cos 4x dx

USE:

sin A. cos B = \(\frac{1}{2}\) [sin(A + B)+sin(A + B)]

= \(\frac{1}{2}\)∫ [sin(3x + 4x) + sin(3x – 4x)J dx

= \(\frac{1}{2}\)∫ [sin7x + sin(-x)] dx

= \(\frac{1}{2}\) ∫[sin7x + sin x] dx




Question 19.

Evaluate : ∫logx dx.

Answer:

I = ∫logx dx = ∫logx.1 dx

= ∫uv dx =u∫v dx – ∫[\(\frac{d}{d x}\) x∫vdx] dx

Iogx ∫1. dx_∫[\(\frac{d}{d x}\) (logx)x∫1.dx] dx

=1ogx(x)∫( \(\frac{1}{x}x x\) ) dx

=xlogx – ∫1. dx

I = x logx – x + c

Answer:



\(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}} . \overrightarrow{\mathrm{b}}\) = 6(4)+2(-4) + (-8)(2)

= 24 – 8 – 16

=0

=> \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\) is Δ
r
 to b

Take any two non – zero perpendicular vectors \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{a}}\) & \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{b}}\)

Hence, the convrse need not be true


Question 22.

the set A = {l,2,3,4,5,6}

Answer:




Part – C


Answer any Ten Questions : ( 10 x 3 = 30 )


Question 25.

Determine whether the relation R in the set A={I,2,3,4,5,6} as R={x,y}:y is divisible by x} is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

Answer:

(1) R is reflexive, as (a,a) ∈ R ⇒ a is

divisible by a ∴ R is reflexive.

(2) Let (1,2) ∈ R ⇒ 2 is divisible by 1

But (2,1) ∈ R ⇒ 1 cannot divide by 2

∴ R is not symmetric.

(3) Let (1,2)∈ R ⇒ 1(2, 4)ER

⇒ 2 is divisible by I and 4 is divisibly by 2

Now, (1,4) ∈ R ⇒ 4 is divisible by 1

∴  (1,2)∈ R I(2,4) ∈ R ⇒ (1,4)∈ R

∴ R is transitive.


Question 26.

Find the values of x, if



Answer:



⇒x
2
 = 4 – 3 = 1

∴ x = ±1

Question 29.

Verify Mean value theorem for the

function f(x) = x
3
 – 5x
2
 – 3x , in the interval[a,b] where a= 1 and b = 3

(1) f(x) = x
3
 – 5x
2
 – 3x is continuous in [1,3]

(2) f
1
(x) = 3x
2
 – 10x – 3 exists in [1, 3]



3c
2
 – 10c – 3 +10 = 0

3c
2
 – 10c + 7 = 0

= 3c
2
 – 3c – 7c + 7 = 0

= 3c (c – 1) – 7 (c – 1) = 0

=(3c – 7) ((c- 1)) = 0

c = \(\frac{7}{3}\) or c=1

But c ∉ (1,3) ∴c = \(=\frac{7}{3}\)∈ (1 , 3 )




Question 30.

Find two positive numbers whose sum is 16 and the sum of whose cubes is minimum.

Answer:

Let one number be x. Then other number is (16 – x)

Let S(x) = x
3
 +(16 – x)
3

S
1
 (x) = 3x
2
 +3(16 – x)
2
 (-1)

S
11
(x) =6x + 6(16 -x)
1
(+1)

S
1
(x) = 0 gives, 3x
2
 – 3 (16 – x)
2
 =0

⇒ x
2
 – (16 – x)
2
 =0

⇒ x
2
 = (16 – x)
2

⇒ x
2
 – 256 + x
2
 – 32x

⇒ 32x = 256

x = \(\frac{256}{32}\)

x =8

Also, S
11
 (x) = 6(8)+ 6(16 – 8)

= 48 + 6(8)

= 48 + 48

= 96 > 0

∴ By second derivative test, x = 8 is the point of local minima of s.

Hence sum of cubes of numbers is

minimum when the numbers are 8 and 16-8 = 8

2
 and the line y=4

Answer:



Given y = x
2
 and y = 4

To find A and B:

put y = 4 in y = x
2

⇒ x
2
 = 4

⇒ x =±2

put x = 2, y = 4 ⇒(2,4)

x = -2, y = 4 ⇒ (-2,4)

\(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}=3 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+5 \hat{\mathbf{j}}+2 \hat{\mathbf{k}}\) which has magnitude 10 units.

Answer:

Let \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}=2\) \(\hat{\mathbf{i}}+\hat{\mathbf{j}}+3 \hat{\mathbf{k}}\) and

\(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}=3 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+5 \hat{\mathbf{j}}+2 \hat{\mathbf{k}}\)



= î[- 2 – 15] – ĵ[-4 – 9] + k̂[10 – 3]

= î[-17] – ĵ [-13] + k̂[7]

= -17î + 13 ĵ + 7k̂




Question 36.

Show that the points and A (-1, 4, -3), B(3,2,-5) C (-3,8,-5) D(-3,2,1)are coplanar.

\(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{BC}}=-6 \hat{\mathrm{i}}+6 \hat{\mathrm{j}}+0 \hat{\mathrm{k}}\)

\(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{CD}}=0 \hat{\mathrm{i}}-6 \hat{\mathrm{j}}+6 \hat{\mathrm{k}}\)



= 4[36 + 0] + 2 [- 36 – o] – 2[36 – 0]

= 144 – 72 – 72 = 144 – 144 = 0

∴ A, B, C & D arc coplanar.

Answer;




Question 38.

A die is thrown. If E is the event “the number appearing is a multiple of 3” and F be the event “The number appearing is even”. Then find whether E and F are independent

Answer:

s = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

E={3,6} ∴P(E) = \(\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}\)

F={2,4,6} ∴ P(F) = \(\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}\)

we have, P(EnF) = P(E)P(F)

\(\frac{1}{6}\) = \(\frac{1}{3} x \frac{1}{2}\)

\(\frac{1}{6}\) = \(\frac{1}{6}\)

∴ E and F are Independent

Question 49.

(a). A manufacturer produces nuts and bolts. It takes 1 hour of work on machine A and 3 hours on machine B to produce a package of nuts. It takes 3 hours on machine A and 1 hour on machine B to produce a package of bolts. He earns a profit of Rs 17.50 per package on nuts and Rs7.OO per package on bolts. How many packages of each should be produced each day so as to maximize his profit if he operates his machines for at the most 12 hours a day?

Let x → nuts, y → bolts



Maximimum: Z = Rs. 17.50 x + Rs 7.00 y

x + 3 ≤ 1 2

3x + y ≤ 12 where, xy ≥ 0



The shaded portion OAED Represents feasible region and it is bounded.

The feasible solution is obtained at all these comer points.

and x = b, t=a






(b). Find all the points of discontinuity on f defined by f(x) =|x| – |x+1|

Answer:

f(x) = |x| – |x+1|

f(c)= |c | – |c+1|

Let c = O, f(0) = |0 |-|1| = 0-1= -1

Lt f(x) = It|x| – |x+1|= |c| – |c+1|

x→ c X → C

let c = 0, Lt f(x)=0 – 1 = – 1

x—+0

∴ \(\underset{x \rightarrow 0}{\mathrm{Lt}}\) f(x) = f(0)=-1

⇒ f is continuous at x =0

There is no point of Discontinuity.
