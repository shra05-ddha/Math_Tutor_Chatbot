Solution:

Let e be the identity element.

a * e = a

⇒ \(\frac{a e}{4}\) = a

⇒ e = 4

Solution:

3 – x
2
 = 3 – 8

⇒ x
2
 = 8

⇒ x = ±√8 = ±2√2

2

\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = cos(x
2
) . 2x

Question 10.

If P(A) = 0.8 and P(B|A) = 0.4 then find P(A∩B).

Solution:

P(A∩B) = P(A) × P(B/A)= 0.8 × 0.4 = 0.32


Part – B


Answer any TEN questions: (10 × 2 = 20)


Question 11.

Show that if f : A → B and g : B → C are onto, then gof : A → C is also onto.

Solution:

Given an arbitrary element z – C, there exists a pre-image y of z under g such that g(y) = z i.e., g is onto. Further, for y ∈ B, there exists an element x in A with f(x) = y, since f is onto. Therefore, gof(x) = g(fx)) = g(y) = z, showing that gof is onto.

Question 24.

If A and B are two independent events, then prove that the probability of occurrence of at least one of A and B is given by 1 – P(A’) P(B’).

Solution:

P(Atleast one of A or B) = P(A ∪ B) [∵ A and B are independent events]

= P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)

= P(A) + P(B) – P(A) . P(B)

= P(A) + P(B) – (1 – P(A))

= 1 – P(A’) + P(B) P(A’)

= 1 – [P(A’) + P(B)P(A’)]

= 1 – P(A’) [1 – P(B)]

= 1 – P(A’) P(B’)

= RHS.


Part – C


Answer any TEN questions: (10 × 3 = 30)


Question 25.

Check whether the relation R defined in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} as R = {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is reflexive or symmetric.

Solution:

R = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)}

2 ∈ A, But (2, 2) ∉ R

∴ R is not reflexive

(2, 3) ∈ R, But (3, 2) ∉ R

∴ R is not Symmetric

Question 29.

Verify Mean Value Theorem for the function f(x) = x
2
 in the interval [2, 4].

Solution:

The function f(x) = x
2
 is continuous in {2, 4} and differentiable in {2, 4} as its derivative f(x) = 2x is defined in (2, 4).

Now f(2) = 4 and f(4) = 16. Hence



MVT states that there is a point c ∈ (2, 4) such that f'(c) = 6. But f'(x) = 2x which implies c = 3.

Thus at c = 3 ∈ (2, 4), we have f'(c) = 6.

Solution:

P(S
1
) = Probability that six occurs = \(\frac{1}{6}\)

P(S
2
) = Probability that six does not occur = \(\frac{5}{6}\)

P(E|S
1
) = Probability that man reports that six occurs when six has actually on the die = Probability that the truth occurs = \(\frac{3}{4}\)




Part – D


Answer any SIX questions: (6 × 5 = 30)

Question 43.

Sand is pouring from a pipe at the rate of 12 cm
3
/s. The falling sand forms a cone on the ground in such a way that the height of the cone is always one-sixth of the radius of the base. How fast is the height of the sand cone increasing when the height is 4 cm?

Solution:

Let r be the radius, h be the height and V be the volume of the sand cone at any time t.



Hence, when the height of the sand cone is 4 cm, its height is increasing at the rate of \(\frac{1}{48 \pi}\) cm/s

Part – E


Answer any ONE question: (1 × 10 = 10)


Question 49(a).

Minimize z = -3x + 4y subject to the constraints

x + 2y ≤ 8

3x + 2y ≤ 12

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0

by graphical method.

Solution:

Draw the graph of the line, x + 2y = 8



Putting (0, 0) in the inequality x + 2y ≤ 8, we have

0 + 0 ≤ 8

0 ≤ 8 (which is true)

So, the half-plane is towards the origin,

Since, x, y ≥ 0

So, the feasible region lies in the first quadrant.

Draw the graph of the line, 3x + 2y = 12



Putting (0, 0) in the inequality 3x + 2y ≤ 12, we have

3 x 0 + 2 x 0 ≤ 12 ⇒ 0 ≤ 12 (which is true)

So, the half-plane is towards the origin,

The feasible region is OABCO.

On solving equations x + 2y = 8 and x = 2 and y = 3

Intersection point B is (2, 3)

The corner points of the feasible region are O(0, 0), A (4, 0) and B(2, 3) and C(0, 4).

The values of Z at these points are as follows:



Therefore, the maximum value of Z is -12 at point A(4, 0).






Question 49(b).

Prove that: \(\left|\begin{array}{ccc}1 & a & a^{2} \\1 & b & b^{2} \\1 & c & c^{2}\end{array}\right|=(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)\)

Solution:






Question 50(a).

Prove that:



Solution:



f(x) = x
3
 + x cos x

f(-x) = (-x)
3
 – x cos (-x) = -x
3
 – x cos x = -[x
3
 + x cos x] = -f(x)

∴ f(x) is odd

∴ \(\int_{-\pi / 2}^{\pi / 2}\left(x^{3}+x \cos x\right) d x=0\)




Question 50(b).

For what value of λ is the function defined by



Solution:

When x < 0, f(x) = λ(x
2
 – 2x) being a polynomial is continous. When x > 0, f(x) = 4x + 1 being a polynomial is continous.

At x = 0

f(0) = λ(0
2
 – 2 × 0) = 0



∴ LHL ≠ RHL

∴ lim f(x) does not exists for x = 0

∴ f is discontinous at x = 0 for any value of λ.
