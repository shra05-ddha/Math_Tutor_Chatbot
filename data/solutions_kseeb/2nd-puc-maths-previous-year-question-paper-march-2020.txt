Karnataka 2nd PUC Maths Previous Year Question Paper March 2020


Time: 3 Hrs 15 Min

Max. Marks: 100


 






Instructions:




The question paper has five parts namely A, B, C, D, and E. Answer all the parts.


Use the graph sheet for the question on Linear programming in Part E




Part – A


 






Answer ALL the following questions: (10 × 1 = 10)


Question 1.

Let * be the binary operation on N given by a * b = LCM of a and b. Find 5 * 7.

Solution:

5 * 7 = LCM of 5 and 7 = 35


 






Question 2.

Write the range of the function y = sec
-1
 x.

Solution:

[0, π] – {\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)}


Question 3.

If a matrix has 5 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?

Solution:

1 × 5 and 5 × 1




Question 4.

Find the values of x for which \(\left|\begin{array}{cc}x & 2 \\18 & x\end{array}\right|=\left|\begin{array}{cc}6 & 2 \\18 & 6\end{array}\right|\)

Solution:

x
2
 – 36 = 36 – 36

⇒ x
2
 = 36

⇒ x = ±6


 






Question 5.

Solution:




Question 6.

Find ∫(2x
2
 + e
x
) dx.

Solution:




 






Question 7.

Define the Negative of a vector.

Solution:

A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector but direction is opposite to that of it is called negative of a vector.




 






Question 8.

If a line makes angles 90°, 135° and 45° with the X, Y and Z-axes respectively, find its direction cosines.

Solution:

Let direction cosines of the line be l, m and n with the X, Y, and Z-axes respectively, and given that

α = 90°, β = 135° and γ = 45°

Then, l = cos α = cos 90° = 0

m = cos β = cos 135° = \(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)

and n = cos γ = cos 45° = \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\)

Therefore, the direction cosines of the line are 0, \(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).


Question 9.

Any feasible solution of LPP which maximizes or minimizes the objective function is called an optimal solution.

-1
(-x) = π – cot
-1
 x, ∀ x ∈ R.

Solution:

Let cot
-1
(-x) = α

⇒ -cot α = -x

⇒ -cot α = x

⇒ cot(π – α) = x

⇒ π – α = cot
-1
 x

⇒ α = π – cot
-1
 x

⇒ cot
-1
 (-x) = π – cot
-1
 x


Question 13.

(sin \(\frac{3 \pi}{5}\))

Solution:




Question 14.

Solution:




Question 15.

Find \(\frac{d y}{d x}\), if sin
2
 x + cos
2
 y = 1.

Solution:

2 sin x cos x + 2 cos y(-sin y) \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = 0

⇒ \(\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{2 \sin x \cos x}{2 \sin y \cos y}=\frac{\sin 2 x}{\sin 2 y}\)


Question 16.

If y = x
x
, find \(\frac{d y}{d x}\).

Solution:




Question 17.

Find the interval in which the function f given by f(x) = x
2
 – 4x + 6 is strictly decreasing.

Solution:

We have f(x) = x
2
 – 4x + 6

⇒ f'(x) = 2x – 4

Therefore, f'(x) = 0 gives x = 2.

Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two disjoint intervals namely (-∞, 2) and (2, ∞).

In the interval (-∞, 2), f'(x) = 2x – 4 < 0. Therefore, f is strictly decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval (2, ∞) f'(x) > 0 and so the function f is strictly increasing in this interval.

Solution:

Put log sin x = t

Question 23.

Find the equation of the plane with intercepts 2, 3 and 4 on the X, Y and Z-axes respectively.

Solution:

\(\frac{x}{2}+\frac{y}{3}+\frac{z}{4}=1\)




Question 24.

A random variable X has the following probability distribution:



Find the value of K.

Solution:

ΣP(x) = 1

⇒ 0.1 + K + 2K + 2K + K = 1

⇒ 0.1 + 6K = 1

⇒ 6K = 1 – 0.1 = 0.9

⇒ K = 0.9/6 = 0.15


Part – C

) ∈ R

∴ R is transitive

∴ R is an equivalence relation.

There exists at least one value c ∈ (1, 4) such that f'(c) = \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\)

a = 1, f(a) = f(1) = 12 – 4(1) – 3 = 1 – 4 – 3 = 1 – 7 = -6

b = 4, f(b) = f(4) = 42 – 4(4) – 3 = 16 – 16 – 3 = -3

f'(c) = 2c – 4

Question 39.

Show that the function f : R → R given by f(x) = 4x + 3 is invertible. Find the inverse of f.

Solution:

Let f(x

) = 4x
1
 + 3 = 4x
2
 + 3

⇒ 4x
1
 = 4x
2

⇒ x
1
 = x
2

∴ f is one-one.

Let y ∈ Y ∃ x ∈ N such that y = 4x + 3

∴ f is onto.

∴ f is bijective.

Consider an arbitrary element y of Y. By the definition of Y, y = 4x + 3, for some x in the domain N.

x = \(\frac{y-3}{4}\)

Define a function g : Y → N by g(y) = \(\frac{y-3}{4}\)

3
/sec. The falling sand forms a cone on the ground in such a way that the height of the cone is always one-sixth of the radius of the base. How fast is the height of the sand cone increasing when the height is 4 cm?

Solution:

Let r be the radius, h be the height and V be the volume of sand cóne at any time t.



Hence, when the height of the sand cone is 4 cm, its height is increasing at the rate of \(\frac{1}{48 \pi}\) cm/s

Question 47.

Derive the equation of a line in space passing through a given point and parallel to a given Vector and Cartesian form.

Solution:

Vector Form

Let \(\vec{a}\) be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the rectangular

coordinate system. Let l be the line which passes through point A and is parallel to a given vector \(\vec{b}\). Let \(\vec{r}\) be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the line Fig.

Then \(\vec{AP}\) is parallel to the vector \(\vec{b}\), i.e., \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{AP}}=\lambda \vec{b}\), where λ is some real number.

But \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{AP}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{OP}}-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{AO}}\)

i.e., \(\lambda \vec{b}=\vec{r}-\vec{a}\)

Conversely, for each value of the parameter λ, this equation gives the position vector of a point P on the line. Hence, the vector equation of the line is given by

\(\vec{r}=\vec{a}+\lambda \vec{b}\) ……. (1)



Cartesian Form

Let the coordinates of the given point A be (x
1
, y
1
, z
1
) and the direction ratios of the line be a, b, c.

Consider the coordinates of any point P be (x, y, z). Then \(\vec{r}=x \hat{i}+y \hat{j}+z \hat{k} ; \vec{a}=x_{1} \hat{i}+y_{1} \hat{j}+z_{1} \hat{k}\) and \(\vec{b}=a \hat{i}+b \hat{j}+c \hat{k}\)

Substituting these values in (1) and equating the coefficients of \(\hat{i}, \hat{j} \text { and } \hat{k}\), we get

x = x
1
 + λa ; y = y
1
 + λb ; z = z
1
 + λc …….. (2)

These are parametric equations of the line. Eliminating the parameter λ from (2), we get

\(\frac{x-x_{1}}{a}=\frac{y-y_{1}}{b}=\frac{z-z_{1}}{c}\)

This is tle Cartesian equation of the line.


Question 48.

A person buys a lottery ticket in 50 lotteries, in each of which his chance of winning a prize is \(\frac{1}{100}\). What is the probability that he will win a prize (a) exactly once (b) at least once?
