Question 11.

Show that if f: A → B and g: B → C are one – one, then gof : A → C is also one – one

Answer:

gof (x
1
) = gof(x
2
)

g[f(x
1
)]=g[(x
2
)]

f(x
1
) = f(x
2
)

x
1
 = x
2

since g and f is one – one, gof is one – one


Question 12.

Let x = sin θ ⇒ θ = sin
-1
 x

2x \(\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\) = 2 sin θ \(\sqrt{1-\sin ^{2}} \theta\)

2 sin θ. cos θ = sin 2θ

2
 + xy + y
2
 = 100

Answer:

2x + x\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) + y + 2y \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = 0

(x + 2y)\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = -(2x + y)

\(\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{-(2 x+y)}{x+2 y}\)

Question 28.

verify Rolles theorem for the funciton f(x)= x
2
 + 2X – 8, x ∈[-4,2]

Answer:

f (x) =x
2
 +2x – 8

1. f (x) being a polynominal function it is continuous on (-4,2)

2. Also f
1
 (x) = 2x + 2 hence derivable on (-4,2)

3. f(-4) = (-4)
2
 + 2(-4) -8 = 0

f(2) = 2
2
 + 2(2) – 8 =0

∴ f(-4) = f(2)

∴ All three conditions of Rolle’s theorem are verified.

f
1
 (c) = 0

f
1
 (c) = 2c + 2 ⇒ 0 = 2c + 2

⇒ c = -1 ∈(-4,2)


Question 29.

Answer:






Question 30.

Find the two positive numbers whose sum is 15 and sum of whose squares is minimum.

Answer:

x + y = 15 ⇒ y = 15 – x

s = x
2
 + y
2
 ⇒ s = x
2
 + (15 – x)
2

\(\frac{d s}{d x}\) = 2x + 2(15 – x) (-1)

\(\frac{d s}{d x}\) = 0 2x – 30 + 2x

0 = 4x – 30

x = \(\frac { 30 }{ 4 }\) = 7.5

\(\frac{d^{2} s}{d x^{2}}=2+2=4>0\)

∴ x = 7.5 require no is y = 7.5 & x = 7.5

3(2) – 2 + 2(1) -4 + λ(2 + 2 + 1 + 2)=0

2 + 7λ = 0

λ = \(\frac { -2 }{ 7 }\)

Required equqtion of plane is

(3x – y + 2z – 4) + \(\left(\frac{-2}{7}\right)\) (x + yz + 2) + 0 [x
ly

2
 ∴ f (x) is one-one

Let y = f(x)

y = 4x +3

x = \(\frac{y-3}{4}\) ∈R
+
 ∴ f (x) is onto

Let

f
-1
 (x) = y

f(y) = x

4y +3 =x

\(y=\frac{x-3}{4}\)

∴ f
-1

Question 43.

A particle moves along the curve 6y = x
3
 + 2. Find the points on the curve at which the y – coordinate is changing 8 times as fast as the x – coordinate.

Answer:

6y = x
3
 + 2 → (l)

\(\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{x^{2}}{2}\)

Given that \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = 8 \(\frac{d x}{d t}\) ⇒ \(\frac{d x}{d t}\) = 8

∴ 8 = \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) x
2

x = ±4

put x in Equation (01) 6y = 4
3
 + 2

∴ x = 4 y = 11

∴ x = -4 , 6y = (-4)
3
 + 2 ⇒ y = -10,3 points are (4,11) (-4, -10,3)


Question 44.

Answer:






Question 45.

Using integration find the area of the triangular region whose sides have the equations y = 2x + 1, y = 3x + 1 and x = 4



Answer:

y = 2x – 1

points are (0,1) (1,3) (4,9) etc

x = 4, (4,0) (4,1) (4,2) etc

Area = \(\int_{0}^{4}(3 x+1), d x-\int_{0}^{4}(2 x+1), d x\)

\(A=\left(\frac{3 x^{2}}{2}+x\right)^{4}-\left(\frac{2 x^{2}}{2}+x\right)^{4}\)

A = 24 + 4 – 16 – 4 = 8 sq units


Question 46.

Solve the differential equation \(\frac{d y}{d x}+y\) sec x = tan x,0 ≤ x < \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)

Answer:

P = secx Q = tan x

IF = \(e^{\int \sec x d x}=e^{\log (\sec x+\tan x)}\) = secx + tanx

y x IF = ∫ Q x IF

y (sec + tan x) = ∫(sec x + tan x) tan x.dx = ∫sec x.tan x + ∫ tan
2
 x.dx

=secx + ∫(sec

 x – 1) dx

y(sec x+tan x) = sec x + tan x – x + c

AP is parallel to vector \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{b}}\)

\(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{AP}}=\lambda \overrightarrow{\mathrm{b}}\)

Question 48.

A die is thrown 6 times. If ‘getting an odd number’is a success, what is probability of:

a) 5 successes?

Answer:

\(P(5)=6_{c_{3}}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6-5}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{5}=6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{32}\right)=\frac{3}{32}\)


b) at least 5 successes?

Answer:

\(P(x \geq 5)=P(5)+P(6)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6}\left[6_{C_{5}}+6_{C_{6}}\right]=\frac{6}{64}+\frac{1}{64}=\frac{7}{64}\)


c) at most successes?

Answer:

P(X≤ 5) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6}\) [1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6] = \(\frac { 63 }{ 64 }\)

Question 50.

a) A manufacturing company makes two models A and B of a product. Each piece Of model A requires 9 labour hours for fabricating and 1 labour hour for finishing. Each piece of model B requires 12 labour hours for finishing and 3 labour hours for finishing. For fabricating and finishing, the maximum labour hours available are 180 and 30 respectively. The company makes a profit of Rs. 8,000 on each piece of model A and Rs. 12,000 on each piece of model B. How many pieces of model A and model B should be manufactured per week to realize a maximum profit? What is the maximum profit per week?

Answer:



Z = 8000x + 12000y
