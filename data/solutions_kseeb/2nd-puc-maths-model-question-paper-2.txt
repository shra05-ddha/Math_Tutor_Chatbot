II. Answer any TEN questions : ( 10 × 2 = 20 )


Question 11.

Verify whether the operation * defined on Q by a*b = \(\frac{\mathrm{ab}}{2}\) is associative or not.

Answer:

* is defined on Q by a*b = \(\frac{\mathrm{ab}}{2}\) for associative we have to prove that

a* (b* c) = (a* b)* c

∴ a*(b*c) = a * \(\frac{\mathrm{ab}}{2}\) b*c = \(\frac{\mathrm{bc}}{2}\)

= \(\frac{\mathrm{abc}}{4}\) ……………….. (1)

(a*b)*c = \(\frac{\mathrm{ab}}{2}\) *c

= \(\frac{\mathrm{abc}}{4}\) ……………….. (2)

∴ from (1) and (2)

∴ * is Associative

∴ * Satisfies the associative property.

Question 28.

Find \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) if x = a(cosθ + θsinθ) and dx

y = a(sinθ – θcosθ)

Answer:

x = a(cosθ + θsinθ)

Diff w.r.t θ we have

\(\frac{d x}{d \theta}\) = a(-sinθ + θcosθ + sinθ )

\(\frac{d x}{d \theta}\) = a[θcosθ]

y = a(sinθ – θcosθ)

w.r.t θ

\(\frac{d y}{d \theta}\)

= a[cosθ – θ x sin θ – cosθ]

\(\frac{d y}{d \theta}\) = a[sinθ]



∴ \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = tan θ




Question 29.

Verify Rolle’s theorem for the function y = x
2
 + 2, x ∈[-2,2]

Answer:

The function y = x
2
 +2 is continuous in [-2,2], and differentiable in (-2,2)

Also f (-2) ⇒ f (x) = x
2
 + 2

f(- 2) = (-2)
2
 + 2

= 4 + 2 = 6

f(2) = 2
2
 + 2 = 6

∴ f(-2) = f(2) = 6

∴ The value of f(x) at -2 and 2 coincide.

∴ Rolle’s Theorem states that there is a point

c ∈ (-2,2) where f'(c) = 0

Since f'(x) = 2x, we have

f’ (c) = 2c

2c = 0

c = 0

∴ we have c = 0 ∈ (-2,-2)


Question 30.

Find the interval in which the function f given by f (x) = x
2
 – 4x + 6 is

(i) Strictly increasing.

(ii) Strictly decreasing.

Answer:

f(x) = x
2
 – 4x + 6

Differentiate w.r.t x

f'(x) = 2x – 4

∴ f'(x) = 0 gives

0 = 2x – 4

2x = 4

x = 2



∴ The point x = 2 divides the real line into two disjoint intervas namely, (-∞,2) and (2,∞).

The interval (-∞, 2) f'(x) = 2x – 4 < 0.

∴ f is strictly decreasing in (-∞, 2). Also in the interval (2,∞) f'(x)>0 and so the function f is strictly increasing in (2,∞).


Question 31.

Find \(\int \frac{\left(x^{2}+1\right) \cdot e^{x}}{(x+1)^{2}} \cdot d x\)

Question 33.

Find the area of the region bounded by the curve y = x
2
 and the line y = 4.

Answer:

y = x
2
 represents the parabola symmetrical about y – axis




∴ The Area of the region AOBA is given by 2 \(\int_{0}^{4} x \cdot d y=2\) [Area of the region BONB bounded by curve, y-axis and the lines y=0 and y=4]




Question 34.

Form the differential equation representing the family of curves y=mx where m is arbitrary constant.

Answer:

The given family of curves represents the equation of straight lines.

∴ y = mx ……………………. (1)

Differentiate w.r.t x, we get dy

\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = m

∴ substitute m = \(\frac{d y}{d x}\), we have

y = mx

⇒ y = \(\frac{d y}{d x}\) x

\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) = \(\frac{y}{x}\)

\(\frac{d y}{d x} – \frac{y}{x}\) = 0

which is the required differential equation.


Question 35.

Prove that



Answer:




Question 36.

If \(\vec{a}=2 \vec{i}+2 \hat{j}+3 \hat{k} \overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}=-\hat{\mathbf{i}}+2 \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\hat{\mathbf{k}} and [latex]\overrightarrow{\mathbf{c}}=3 \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\hat{\mathbf{j}}\)  are such that \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}+\lambda \overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}\) is perpendicular to \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{c}}\). Then find the value of λ.

Answer:




Question 37.

Find the distance of a point (2, 5, -3) from the plane \(\vec{r} \cdot(6 \hat{i}-3 \hat{j}+2 \hat{k})=4\)

Answer:

\(\vec{a}=2 \hat{i}+5 \hat{j}-3 \hat{k}\)

\(\vec{N}=6 \hat{i}-3 \hat{j}+2 \hat{k}\)

d = 4

distance of a point from a plane is



∴ The distance of the point (2, 5 – 3) from the

given plane is




Question 38.

A die is tossed thrice. Find the probability of getting an odd number at least once.

Answer:

When a dice is tossed thrice, the sample space, is S = {(x,y,z):x,y z e (1,2,3,4,5,6}}

which contains 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 Equally likely sample points.

Let E : “an odd number at least once”

E
1
 : not an odd number any time

E
1
 : “An even number on all throws”

E
1
 = {(x,y,z):x,y,ze{2,4,6}j

e

 contains 3x3x3=27 equally likely simple events.

Required probability = P(E) = 1 – P(E).

= \(1-\frac{27}{216}=1-\frac{1}{8}=\frac{7}{8}\)

V. Answer any ONE questions : ( 1 × 10 = 10 )


Question 49.

a) Minimize and maximize Z = x + 2y subject to the constraints,

x + 2y ≥ 100

2x – y ≤ 0

2x + y ≤ 200

x, y ≥ 0 by graphical method.

Our problem is to minimize and maximize

Z = x + 2y …………..(1)

Subject to constraints are

x + 2y ≥ 100 …………….(2)

2 x – y ≤ 0 ……………..(3)

2x + y ≤ 200…………….(4)

x> 0, x>0…………….(5)

∴ x + 2y- 100 which passes through the points A( 100,0) and B(0,50)

2x – y = 0 which passes through the points (0,0) and (20,4 0)

2x + y = 200 which passes through the points A(100,0)&C (0,200)

∴ The comer points of feasible region are 5(0,50) P(20,40) 0(50,100) and C(0,200).

At B (0,50) ⇒ Z = 0 + 2 × 50 = 100

At P(20,40) ⇒ Z = 20 + 2 × 40 – 100

At Q(5O,1OO) ⇒ Z = 50 + 2 × 100 = 250

At C(0,200) Z = 0 + 2 × 200 = 400

Hence max Z = 400 at (0, 200) and

Min Z = 100 at B and also at P.
