(i) The problem is solved

= 1 – P(not solved) = 1 – P(A’ ∩ B’)

= 1 – P(A’) P(B’) = 1 – [(1 – \(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) – (1 – \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\)]

= 1 – (\(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) × \(\frac { 2 }{ 3 }\)) = 1 – \(\frac { 1 }{ 3 }\) = \(\frac { 2 }{ 3 }\)


(ii) Exactly one of them solves problem

= P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B’)

= P(A’) + P(B) + P(A) P(B’)

\(=\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right)\)

\(=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\)


Part-C


Answer any TEN questions: (10 × 3 = 30)


Question 25.

Check whether the relation R in 1R of real numbers defined by R = {(a, b): a < b
3
} is reflexive, symmetric or transitive.

Answer:

(i) For (a, a) ∈R, a < a
3
 which is false.

As for a = -2, a
3
 = -8

∴ a \(\nleq\) a
3
 as – 2 \(\nleq\) – 8

∴ R is not reflexive.


(ii) For (a, b), a < b
3
 and (b, a), b < a
3
 which is false

As for a = 1 and b = 2

a < b
3
 as 1 < 8

Now, b \(\nleq\) a
3
 as 2 \(\nleq\) 1

∴ R is not symmetric.


(iii) For (a, b), (b, c) and (a, c)

a < b
3
 and b < c
3

Now a = 25, b = 3, c = 2

a < b
3
 and 25 < 27

b < c
3
 and 3 < 8

but a \(\nleq\) c
3
 as 25 \(\nleq\) 8

.’. R is not transitive.

Hence R is neither reflexive, nor symmetric and nor transitive.


Question 26.

Prove that

cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 4 }{ 5 }\)) + cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 12 }{ 13 }\)) = cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 33 }{ 65 }\))

Answer:

Let

cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 4 }{ 5 }\)) ⇒ cos A = \(\frac { 4 }{ 5 }\) ⇒ Sin A = \(\sqrt{1-\frac{16}{25}}=\frac{3}{5}\)

cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 12 }{ 13 }\)) = cos B = \(\frac { 12 }{ 13 }\) ⇒ sin B = \(\sqrt{1-\frac{144}{169}}=\frac{5}{13}\)

cos(A + B) = cosA.cosB – sinA.sinB \(=\frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{12}{13}-\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{13}=\frac{48}{65}-\frac{15}{65}=\frac{33}{65}\)

cos(A + B) = \(\frac { 33 }{ 65 }\) ⇒ A + B = cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 33 }{ 65 }\))

cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 4 }{ 5 }\)) + cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 12 }{ 13 }\)) = cos
-1
 (\(\frac { 33 }{ 65 }\))




Question 27.

Answer:




Question 28.

If x = a(θ + sin θ), y = a(1 – cosθ) then show that \(\frac{d y}{d x}=\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\)

Answer:

We have

\(\frac{d x}{d \theta}\) = a(1 + cos θ), \(\frac{d y}{d \theta}\) = a(sin θ)






Question 29.

Verify Rolle’s theorem for the function f(x) = x
2
 + 2x – 8, x ∈ [-4, 2].

Answer:

f(x) is a polynomial in x. Hence it is continuous over [-4, 2] and differentiable over (-4,2).

f(-4) = (-4)
2
 + 2 (-4) – 8 = 16 – 8 – 8 = 0

f(2) = 4 + 4 – 8 = 0

∴ f(-4) = f(2)

∴ All the conditions of the Rolle’s theorem are satisfied.

∴ there exists a c ∈[-4,2] such that

f'(c) = 0 f'(x) = 2x + 2

f(c) = 2c + 2

f(c) = 0

⇒ 2c + 2 = 0

⇒ 2c = -2

⇒ c = -1 ∈[-4, 2]

∴ Rolle’s theorem is verified.


Question 30.

Find the intervals in which the function f given by f(x) = 2X
3
 – 3x
2
 – 36x + 7 is strictly increasing.

Answer:

f(x) = 2x
3
 – 3x
2
 – 36x + 7

f ‘(x) = 6x
2
 – 6x – 36

f ‘(x) = 0 ⇒ 6x
2
 – 6x – 36 = 0



⇒ 6(x
2
 – x – 6) = 0

⇒ 6(x – 3)(x + 2) = 0

6 ≠ 0, x = 3, x = -2




Question 31.

Find \(\int x \log x d x\)

Answer:






Question 32.

Evaluate \(\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin x}{1+\cos ^{2} x} d x\)

Given, y = a e
3x
 + b e
-2x
 …. (1)

y’ = (a e
3x
) 3 – (be
-2x
) 2

y’ = 3 a e
3x
 – 2 be
-2x
 …. (2)

From (1) and (2)

y = a e
3x
 + b e
-2x
 × 3

y’ = 3a e
3x
 – 2b e
-2x
 × 1



Diff

⇒ 3y’ – y” = 5be
-2x

3y’ – y” = -10be
-2x
 ….(4)

From (3) & (4)

3y’ – y” = (-2) (5be
-2x
)

3y’ – y” = -2[3y – y’]

3y’ – y” = -6y + 2y’

y” – y’ – 6y = 0.




Question 35.

Find a unit vector perpendicular to each of the vector \((\vec{a}+\vec{b})\) and \((\vec{a}-\vec{b})\), where ā = î + ĵ + k̂, b̄ = î + 2ĵ + 3k̂.

Answer:

Let



= -2(21 + 0) + 4(7 + 8) – 6(0 + 3)

= -42 + 60 – 18 = -60 + 60 = 0

∴ A, B, C, D are coplanar.


Question 37.

Find the vector equation of the plane passing through the points R(2, 5,-3), S(-2, -3, 5) and T(5, 3, -3).

Answer:



Theorem: Derive intercept form of the equation of a plane

Let the equation of a plane be

Ax + By + Cz + 0 = 0 (1)



Let the plane cuts X – axis at p(a, 0, 0), Y-axis at Q(0, b, 0), Z-axis at R(0, 0, c) substituting P(a, 0, 0) in equation (1)

Aa + D = 0 ⇒ Aa = -D ⇒ A = \(\frac{-D}{a}\)

substituting Q(0, b, 0) in equation (1)

Bb + D = 0 ⇒ Bb = D ⇒ B = \(\frac{-D}{b}\)

R(0, 0, c) in equation (1)

Cc + D = 0 ⇒ Cc = -D ⇒ C = \(\frac{-D}{c}\)

substituting A, B, C in (1)

\(\left(\frac{-D}{a}\right) x+\left(\frac{-D}{b}\right) y+\left(\frac{-D}{c}\right) z=-D\)

Dividing through out by -D

\(\Rightarrow \frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}+\frac{z}{c}=1\)

is the required equation of the plane in intercept form

Question 39.

Let f: N → Y be a function defined as

f(x) = 4x + 3, where

y = {y ∈ N: y = 4x + 3 for some x ∈ N}. Show that f is invertible. Find the inverse of f.

Answer:

f:N → Y

f(x) = 4x + 3

To prove that / is one – one

Let f(x
1
) = f(x
2
)

4x
1
 + 3 = 4x
2
 + 3

4x
1
 = 4x
2

∴ x
1 
= x
2
.

∴ f is one – one

To prove that f is onto

Let y ∈ Y there exits x ∈ N such that

f(x) = y

4x + 3 = y

4x = y – 3, x = \(\frac{y-3}{4}\)

∴ f is one-one and onto

⇒ f is bijective. Hence f is invertible

∴ f
-1
(y) = \(\frac{y-3}{4}\)

Question 41.

Solve the following system of linear equations by matrix method:

3x – 2y + 3z = 8

2x + y – z = 1

4x – 3y + 2z = 4

Answer:

The system of equations can be written in the form A X = B where



|A| = 3(2 – 3) + 2(4 + 4) + 3(-6 -4) = -17

Hence, A is non singular matrix and so its inverse exists. Now

A

12
 = -8 A
13
 = -10

A
21
 = -5 A
22
 = -6 A
23

-1
 x, we have

y
1
 = \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\) i.e., (1 – x

Question 43.

The length x of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of 3 cm / min and the width y is increasing at the rate of 2 cm / min. When x = 10 cm and y = 6 cm, find the rates of change of

(i) the perimeter and

(ii) the area of the rectangle.

Answer:

Since the length x is decreasing and the width y is increasing with respect to time, we have

\(\frac{d x}{d t}\) = – 3 cm /min and \(\frac{d y}{d t}\) = 2 cm/mm

(a) The perimeter P of a rectangel is given by P = 2 (x + y)

Therefore \(\frac{d P}{d t}\) = \(2\left(\frac{d x}{d t}+\frac{d y}{d t}\right)\) = 2 (-3 + 2)

= – 2 cm / min


(b) The area A of the rectangle is given A = x.y

Therefore \(\frac{d A}{d t}\) = \(\frac{d x}{d t}\) . y + x. \(\frac{d y}{d t}\)

= -3(6)+ 10(2) (as x= 10 cm and y = 6 cm)

= 2 cm
2
/min.

Question 45.

Using the method of integration, find the smaller area enclosed by the circle x
2
 + y
2
 = 4 and the line x + y = 2.

Answer:

Given circle x
2
 + y
2
 = 4 and the line is x + y = 2

x
2
 + (2 – x)
2
 = 4

[∴ y = 2 – x]



2x
2
 – 4x = 0 ⇒ 2x(x – 2) = 0 ⇒ x = 0, 2

Now, x
2
 + y
2
 = 4 and x + y = 2

⇒ y
2
 = 4 – x
2
 y = 2 – x,

⇒ y = \(y=\sqrt{2^{2}-x^{2}}\)

Required Area




Question 46.

Find the general solution of the differential equation \(\frac{d y}{d x}\)+ (secx)y = tanx, ( 0 ≤ x ≤ \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)).

Answer:

Given circle x
2
 + y
2
 = 4 and the line is x + y = 2

x
2
 + (2 – x)
2
 = 4 [∴ y = 2 – x]



2x
2
 – 4x = 0 ⇒ 2x(x – 2) = 0 ⇒ x = 0, 2

Now, x
2
 + y
2
 = 4 and x + y = 2

⇒ y
2
 = 4 – x
2 
 y = 2 – x,

⇒ y = \(\sqrt{2^{2}-x^{2}}\)

Question 50.

Minimise and Maximise

z = 5x + 10y

Subject to the constraints :

x + 2y ≤ 120

x + y ≥ 60

x – 2y ≥ 0

x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.

Answer:

Draw the graph of the line



Put (0, 0) in the inequality x + 2y ≤ 120

0 + 2(0) ≤ 120

0 ≤ 120 (True)

∴ The half plane lies towards the origin

P (0, 0) in the inequality x + y ≥ 0

0 + 0 ≥ 0 (False)

∴ The half plane lies away from the origin

Put (0, 1) in the inequality x – 2y ≥ 0

0 – 2(1) ≥ 0

-2 ≥ 0 (False)

∴ The half plane does not contain (0, 1)

Check the point (1, 0) in the inequality

x – 2y ≥ 0

1 – 2 (0) ≥ 0

⇒ 1 ≥ 0 (True)

∴ The half plane contains (1,0)

So the half plane is towards x – axis

Corner points Max & Min z = 5x+ 10y

A (40,20) z = 400

B (60, 30) z = 600 → Maximum

C (60, 0) z = 300 → Minimum

D (120, 0) z = 600 → Maximum

∴ At C (60, 0) z is minimum

At B (60,30), D (120,0) z is maximum


(b) Find the value of K, if

f(x) = \(\left\{\begin{array}{ll}

{K x+1,} & {\text { if } x \leq 5} \\

{3 x-5} & {\text { if } x>3}

\end{array}\right.\)

is continuous at x = 5. (4)

Answer:

Since given f(x) is continous at x = 5 => lim f(x) = lim f(x)=/(5)



⇒ K(5) + 1 = 3(5) – 5

⇒ 5K+ 1 = 10 ⇒ 5K = 9

⇒ K = \(\frac { 9 }{ 5 }\)
