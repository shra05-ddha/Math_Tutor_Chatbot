5.1  Introduction
This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of
differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to
differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and
trigonometric functions. In this chapter, we introduce the
very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and
relations between them. We will also learn differentiation
of inverse trigonometric functions. Further, we introduce a
new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic
functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of
differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious
conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we
will learn some fundamental theorems in this area.
5.2  Continuity
We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider
the function
1, if 0( ) 2, if 0
xf x x
≤=  >
This function is of course defined at every
point of the real line. Graph of this function is
given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the
graph that the value of the function at nearby
points on x-axis remain close to each other
except at x = 0. At the points near and to the
left of 0, i.e., at points like – 0.1, – 0.01, – 0.001,
the value of the function is 1. At the points near
and to the right of 0, i.e., at points like 0.1, 0.01,

0.001, the value of the function is 2. Using the language of left and right hand limits, we
may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In
particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value
of the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw
the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the
paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when
we come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0.
Now, consider the function defined as
f x x
x( ) ,
,= ≠
=



1 0
2 0
if
if
This function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at x = 0
are both equal to 1. But the value of the
function at x = 0 equals 2 which does not
coincide with the common value of the left
and right hand limits. Again, we note that we
cannot draw the graph of the function without
lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of
a function being not continuous at x = 0.
Naively, we may say that a function is
continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the
graph of the function around that point without
lifting the pen from the plane of the paper.
Mathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows:
Definition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let  c be
a point in the domain of f. Then 
f is continuous at c if
lim ( ) ( )
x c
f x f c
→
=
More elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function
at x = c exist and equal to each other, then f is said to be continuous at x = c. Recall that
if the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common
value is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase  the definition of
continuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at
x = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at
x = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point
of discontinuity of f .

Example 1 Check the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = 2x + 3 at x = 1.
Solution
 First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 1. Clearly

Hence, f is continuous at x = 1.
Example 2 Examine whether the function f given by f (x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0.
Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 0. Clearly

Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at

Solution The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1. When x ≠ 0, the

Since the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide with f(0), the function is not continuous
at x = 0. It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function.
Example 5 
Check the points where the constant function f (x) = k is continuous.
Solution The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any
real number equals k. Let c be any real number. Then
lim ( )

Since f (c) = k = lim
x c→  f (x) for any real number c, the function f is continuous at
every real number.
Example 6  Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f (x) = x  is
continuous at every real number.
Solution The function is clearly defined at every point and f (c) = c for every real
number c. Also,
lim ( )

x c

Thus, lim
x c→
f (x) = c = f (c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number.
Having defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural
extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function.
Definition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point
in the domain of f.
This definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose f is a function defined on a
closed interval [a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every
point in [
a, b] including the end points a and b. Continuity of f at a means
lim ( )
x a
f x
+→
= f( a)
and continuity of f  at b means
–
lim ( )
x b
f x
→
= f(b)
Observe that lim ( )
x a
f x

 and lim ( )
x b

do not make sense. As a consequence
of this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous ther e, i.e., if the
domain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function.

Since lim ( ) ( )

Since lim ( ) ( )

is continuous at all points.
Example 8 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by 
f (x) = x3 + x2 – 1.
Solution Clearly f is defined at every real number c and its value at c is c3 + c2 – 1. We
also know that

f is a continuous function.

Also, since for c ≠ 0, 1( )f c c= , we have lim ( ) ( )

at every point in the domain of f. Thus f is a continuous function.

We take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity. This we do by analysing
the function f (x) = 1
x  near x = 0. To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of
finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to
find the right hand limit of f at 0. We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1).
Table 5.1
x 1 0.3 0.2 0.1 = 10–1 0.01 = 10–2 0.001 = 10–3 10–n
f (x) 1 3.333... 5 10 100 = 102 1000 = 103 10n
We observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f (x) shoots up
higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of f (x) may be made larger than any given
number by choosing a positive real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write
0
lim ( )
x
f x
+→
= + ∞
(to be read as: the right hand limit of f (x) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise
that + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as
a real number).
Similarly, the left hand limit of f  at 0 may be found. The following table is self
explanatory.
Table 5.2
x – 1 – 0.3 – 0.2 – 10 –1 – 10–2 – 10 –3 – 10–n
f (x) – 1 – 3.333... – 5 – 10 – 102 – 103 – 10n
From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the
value of f (x) may be made smaller than any
given number by choosing a negative real
number very close  to 0. In symbols,
we write
0
lim ( )
x
f x
−→
= − ∞
(to be read as: the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is
minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise
that – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the
left hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real
number). The graph of the reciprocal function
given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation
of the above mentioned facts.

Solution The function f is defined at all points of the real line.
Case 1 If c < 1, then f (c) = c + 2. Therefore, lim ( ) lim( 2) 2

Thus, f is continuous at all real numbers less than 1.

Since the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1

Since f is continuous at all points in the domain of

we deduce that f is continuous. Graph of this

this function we need to lift the pen from the plane

Case 1 At any point in D1, we have f (x) = x2 and it is easy to see that it is continuous

Case 1 Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the
graph that for all real numbers close to c the value of the function is equal to [c]; i.e.,
lim ( ) lim [ ] [ ]
x c x c
f x x c

= = . Also f (c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real
numbers not equal to integers.
Case 2  Let c be an integer . Then we can find a suf ficiently small real number
r > 0 such that  [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [c + r] = c.
This, in terms of limits mean that
lim
x c −→
f (x) = c – 1, lim
x c +→
f (x) = c
Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is
discontinuous at every integral point.
5.2.1  Algebra of continuous functions
In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some
algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions.
Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at
that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits.
Theorem 1 Suppose f  and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c.
Then
(1) f + g is continuous at x = c.
(2) f – g is continuous at x = c.
(3) f . g is continuous at x = c.
(4)

Hence, 
f + g is continuous at x = c.

Remarks
(i) As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f (x) = λ for some
real number λ, then the function (λ . g) defined by (λ . g) (x) = λ . g(x) is also
continuous. In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f.
(ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f (x) = λ , then the
function g
λ  defined by ( ) ( )xg g x
λ λ = is also continuous wherever g(x) ≠ 0. In
particular, the continuity of g implies continuity of 1
g .
The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They
also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples
illustrate this:
Example 16 Prove that every rational function is continuous.
Solution Recall that every rational function f is given by
( )( ) , ( ) 0( )
p xf x q x q x= ≠
where p and q are polynomial functions. The domain of f is all real numbers except
points at which q is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is
continuous by (4) of  Theorem 1.

Remark A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function.
Example 18 Prove that the function defined by f (x) = tan x is a continuous function.
Solution The function f (x) = tan x = sin
cos
x
x . This is defined for all real numbers such
that cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1) 2
π . We have just proved that both sine and cosine
functions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is
continuous wherever it is defined.
An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to
composition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then
(f o g) (x) = f (g (x))
is defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem
(stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.
Theorem 2 Suppose 
f and g are real valued functions such that (f o g) is defined at c.
If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g (c), then (f o g) is continuous at c.
The following examples illustrate this theorem.
Example 19 Show that the function defined by f (x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function.
Solution Observe that the function is defined for every real number . The function
f may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where
g (x) = sin x and h (x) = x2. Since both g and h are continuous functions, by Theorem 2,
it can be deduced that f is a continuous function.
Example 20 Show that the function f defined by
f (x) = |1 – x + | x||,
where x is any real number, is a continuous function.
Solution Define g by g (x) = 1 – x + | x| and  h by h (x) = | x| for all real x. Then
(h o g) (x) = h (g (x))
= h (1– x + | x |)
= | 1– x + | x | | = f (x)
In Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum
of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f  being a
composite of two continuous functions is continuous.

5.3.  Differentiability
Recall the following facts from previous class. We had defined the derivative of a real
function as follows:
Suppose f is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is
defined by

wherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f. The derivative of f is
denoted by f ′ (x) or ( ( ))d f xdx or if y = f (x) by dy
dx or y′. The process of finding
derivative of a function is called differentiation. We also use the phrase differentiate
f (x) with respect to x to mean find f ′(x).
The following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:
(1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± 
v′
(2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)
(3)

The following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions:
Table 5.3
Whenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists.
Now the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is
its answer. If

to be differentiable in an interval [a, b] if it is differentiable at every point of [a, b]. As
in case of continuity, at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand
limit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function
at a and b respectively. Similarly, a function is said to be differentiable in an interval
(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of (a, b).

point.

Hence f is continuous at x = c.
Corollary 1 Every differentiable function is continuous.
We remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have
seen that the function defined by f (x) = | x | is a continuous function. Consider the left

function.
5.3.1  Derivatives of composite functions
To study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say,
we want to find the derivative of f, where
f (x) = (2x + 1)3
Reprint 2025-26

CONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 121
One way is to expand (2x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as
a polynomial function as illustrated below.
( )d f xdx  =
3(2 1)d xdx
  + 
=
3 2(8 12 6 1)d x x xdx + + +
= 24x2 + 24x + 6
= 6 (2x + 1)2
Now, observe that f (x) = (h o g) (x)
where g(x) = 2x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put 
t = g(x) = 2x + 1. Then f( x) = h(t) = t3. Thus
df
dx  = 6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2x + 1)2 . 2 = 3t2 . 2 = dh dt
dt dx⋅
The advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding
the derivative of, say, (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following
theorem called the chain rule.
Theorem 4 (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two
functions u and v; i.e., f = v o
 u. Suppose t = u(x) and if both dt
dx  and dv
dt  exist, we have
df dv dt
dx dt dx= ⋅
We skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose
f is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w; i.e.,
f = (w 
o u) o v. If t = v( x) and s = u (t), then
( o )df d w u dt dw ds dt
dx dt dx ds dt dx= ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅
provided all the derivatives in the statement exist. Reader is invited to formulate chain
rule for composite of more functions.
Example 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f (x) = sin (x2).
Solution Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if
t = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin 
t, then
f (x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v(x2) = sin x 2
Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS122
Put t = u(x) = x2. Observe that cosdv tdt =  and 2dt xdx =  exist. Hence, by chain rule
df
dx  = cos 2dv dt t xdt dx⋅ = ⋅
It is normal practice to express the final result only in terms of x. Thus

5.3.2  Derivatives of implicit functions
Until now we have been differentiating various functions given in the form y = f (x).
But it is not necessary that functions are always expressed in this form. For example,
consider one of the following relationships between x and y:
x – y – π = 0
x + sin xy – y = 0
In the first case, we can solve for y and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π. In
the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y. Nevertheless,
there is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases. When a
relationship between x 
and y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y and
write y = f (x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x. In the latter case it
Reprint 2025-26

CONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 123
is implicit that y is a function of x and we say that the relationship of the second type,
above, gives function implicitly. In this subsection, we learn to dif ferentiate implicit
functions.

dx  if x – y = π.

5.3.3  Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions
We remark that inverse trigonometric functions are continuous functions, but we will
not prove this. Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions.
Example 24 Find the derivative of f given by f (x) = sin–1 x assuming it exists.
Solution Let y = sin–1 x. Then, x = sin y.
Differentiating both sides w.r.t. x, we get

π π− , i.e., x ≠ – 1, 1,
i.e., x ∈ (– 1, 1).
To make this result a bit more attractive, we carry out the following manipulation.
Recall that for x ∈ (– 1, 1), sin (sin–1 x) = x and hence
cos2 y = 1 – (sin y)2 = 1 – (sin (sin –1 x))2 = 1 –

5.4  Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
Till now we have learnt some aspects of different classes of functions like polynomial
functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions. In this section, we shall
learn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic
functions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are
motivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.
The Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)
= x4. Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the
curve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the
value of x (> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n
= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,
Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS126
where fn (x) = xn. Essentially, this means
that the graph of y  = fn (x) leans more
towards the y-axis as n increases. For
example, consider f10(x) = x10 and 
f15(x)
= x15. If x increases from 1 to 2, f10
increases from 1 to 2 10 whereas f15
increases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same
increment in x, f15 grow faster than f10.
Upshot of the above discussion is that
the growth of polynomial functions is
dependent  on the degree of the polynomial
function – higher the degree, greater is
the growth. The next natural question is:
Is there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in
affirmative and an example of such a function is
y  = f (x) = 10x.
Our claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.
For example, we can prove that 10 x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values
of x like x  = 10 3, note that f100 (x) = (10 3)100 = 10 300 whereas f (103) = 
31010 = 101000.
Clearly f (x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all
x > 103, f (x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly, by
choosing large values of x, one can verify that f (x) grows faster than fn (x) for any
positive integer n.
Definition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function
y = f (x) = bx
The graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.
It is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.
Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:
(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.
(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.
(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a
restatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).
(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the
graph rises above.
Fig  5.9
Reprint 2025-26

CONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 127
(5) For very large negative values of x, the exponential function is very close to 0. In
other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never
meets it).
Exponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function. In
the Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series
1 11 ...1! 2!+ + +
is a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an
extremely important exponential function y = ex.
This is called natural exponential function .
It would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and
has nice interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.
Definition 4 Let b > 1 be a real number. Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if
bx = a.
Logarithm of a to base b is denoted by log b a. Thus logb a = x if bx = 
a.  Let us
work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of
logarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly, 104 = 10000 is equivalent to
saying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 5 4 = 252 is equivalent to saying log 5 625 = 4 or
log25 625 = 2.
On a slightly more mature note, fixing a  base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as
a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the
logarithmic function, is defined by
logb : R+ → R
x → logb x = y   if by = x
As before if the base b = 10, we say it
is common logarithms and if b  = e, then
we say it is natural logarithms . Often
natural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this
chapter , log x  denotes the logarithm
function to base e, i.e., ln x will be written
as simply log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots
of logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.
Some of the important observations
about the logarithm function to any base
b > 1 are listed below:  Fig 5.10
Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS128
 Fig 5.11
(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers
and hence the domain of log function is R+.
(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.
(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.
(4) The log function is ever increasing,
i.e., as we move from left to right
the graph rises above.
(5) For x very near to zero, the value
of log x can be made lesser than
any given real number . In other
words in the fourth quadrant the
graph approaches y-axis (but
never meets it).
(6) Fig 5.11 gives the plot of y = ex and
y =
 ln x. It is of interest to observe
that the two curves are the mirror
images of each other reflected in the line y = x.
Two  properties of ‘log’ functions are proved below:
(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain log a p in terms of logb p. Let
loga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.
Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have
(bγ)α = bγα = p
Using this in the second equation, we get
bβ = p = b γα
which implies β = αγ or α = β
γ . But then
loga p = log
log
b
b
p
a
(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let
logb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.
But then bα = 
pq = bβbγ = bβ + γ
which implies α = β + γ, i.e.,
logb pq = logb p + log b q
Reprint 2025-26

CONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 129
A particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In
this case the above may be rewritten as
logb p 2 =  logb p + log b p = 2 log p
An easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is
logb p n = n log p
for any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will
not attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify
logb
x
y  = logb x – log b y
Example 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?
Solution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.
So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now, let y = elog x. If
y > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log (elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus
y = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.
One of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential
calculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured
in the following theorem whose proof we skip.

5.6  Derivatives of Functions in Parametric Forms
Sometimes the relation between two variables is neither explicit nor implicit, but some
link of a third variable with each of the two variables, separately, establishes a relation
between the first two variables. In such a situation, we say that the relation between

CONTINUITY  AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 135
them is expressed via a third variable. The third variable is called the parameter. More
precisely , a relation expressed between two variables x and y in the form
x = f (t), y = g (t) is said to be parametric form with t as a parameter.
In order to find derivative of function in such form, we have by chain rule.

Summary
® A real valued function is continuous at a point in its domain if the limit of the
function at that point equals the value of the function at that point. A function
is continuous if it is continuous on the whole of its domain.
® Sum, difference, product and quotient of continuous functions are continuous.
i.e., if f and g are continuous functions, then
(f ± g) (x) = f (x) ± g(x) is continuous.
(f . 
g) (x) = f (x) . g(x) is continuous.

® Every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true.
® Chain rule is rule to differentiate composites of functions. If f = v o u, t = u

® Logarithmic differentiation is a powerful technique to differentiate functions
of the form f (x) = [u (x)]v (x). Here both f (x) and u(x) need to be positive for
this technique to make sense.
